# horizonYellTracker
A quick made console app to track yells matching your queries with a discord webhook.

- Discord webhook can be found/created in Channel Settings > Integrations > Webhooks
- User ID can be found by typing "\\@[yourUserNameHere]" into discord ex. <@99999999999999>
- You can set an item to be a bazaar query(along with still being a yell query) by prefixing a "!" ex. !dark ore
- Yell updates are every 30sec. Bazaar updates are every 5 min. These will only include new results, until being reset every 1 hour.
- Bazaar updates include up to 3 new results. One result per unique item, which will be the cheapest found.
